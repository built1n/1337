# Plan

This game idea draws inspiration from the Legend of Zelda and Elite.
None of this is implemented yet.

## Background

You live in the land of Alacron in the year of 238 ABA. The period of relative peace under King Ajax IV has come to an abrupt end with his death under mysterious circumstances.
You are nobody. For now, at least. You've scaped together enough cash to buy some half-decent weapons and armor, and maybe one day fame and fortune could be yours.
But now, the once well-patrolled roads are now teeming with pirate bands, ready to harass the ill-prepared trader, and unfriendly neighbors are vying for power.

The currency in Alacron is the Alacronian Credit (Cr.).
You begin with 500 credits.

### Trading Goods

KEY: < = cheaper in low TL
     > = cheaper in high TL

The given price is the LOWER extreme. Prices for the same good can vary dramatically between different towns and tech levels.

 - Food (1 Cr./kg <)
 - Wood (2 Cr./kg <)
 - Minerals (5 Cr./kg <)
 - Spices (5 Cr./g <)
 - Gems (10 Cr./g <)
 - Gold (20 Cr./g <)

 - Textiles (3 Cr./kg >)
 - Books (5 Cr./kg >)
 - Gunpowder (5 Cr./g >)
 - Luxuries (8 Cr./kg >)
 - Gadgets (10 Cr./kg >)

### "Upgrades"

 - Backpack (100 Cr.): increases the maximum weight which can be carried to 40 kg.

## Game Mechanics

Base HP (no armor) is 10.

### Towns

In the land of Alacron, there are many towns, each with a technology level ranging from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
In a town, you can buy weapons, armor, and trade for goods.
The technology level of a town determines what goods are available for purchase, as well as the prices for those goods: the higher the technology level, the lower the prices.

## Goods

Available for purchase in towns are GOODS. The price of a good depends on the technology level of the town and a random "fluctuation value."
