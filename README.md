Project 1337
============

Project 1337 is destined to be an RPG with a procedurally-generated infinite world.

## Building

### Prerequisites
 - a sane *nix system
 - SDL version 2
 - (n)curses

To build, just run <code>make</code>.
This will build the engine library, an executable linked with the library, and a statically-linked executable not dependent on the library.

## Running

Run with no arguments for SDL, use <code>--curses</code> for curses mode.
